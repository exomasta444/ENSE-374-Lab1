### This is my work for lab 1

    - You will find the following:

        - hw.cpp prints hello world in cpp
        - readme.md file which is this one
        - music.txt which has the name of a song I like
        - branch called alternate
        -still in main, a file called timeline.txt which has the text "best timeline"
        - onlyone.txt which essentiallt says "ONLY ONE"
        -  switching to 2nd branch, we create a time line.txt that says "darkest timeline"
